# SecretEnding

A mod which adds an extra cutscene, based on scrapped voicelines found in the game's files.

The scene can be played from cutscene viewer, under the name "Intercepted Transmission"

Requires FP2 in version 1.1.6 or above to work, since it uses the cutscene menu used in that version.
Text uses a fallback shader since i lack the license to use the one included in Super Text Mesh (Unlike other mods, in this case i would need its source code).
